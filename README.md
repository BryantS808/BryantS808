- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bryant
- Oregon State University
- Sophomore

---- Sorry my projects are currently private, due to school regulations I can't have them public( FOR NOW) and I am working to figure something out. If you want to see them you can message me for collab or I can just make it public for a couple days. 

Im a computer science major as Oregon State Univeristy. I like movies, anime and videogames, I am also an experienced trombone player(7 years), however I am rusty now. I also enjoy swimming at the beach and archery. My favorite games are League, Overwatch, Tarkov and Battlefield.
